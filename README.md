# Learn Node + Redis cache

This is my other attempt at building an application that caches requests using Node + Redis. Code will keep on evolving and changing overtime. For now I am trying to get my feet wet so I feel comfortable with the techStack.

## Running the project

- Install all dependencies by running `yarn`
- Run the command `yarn start` to start up local server on port 4000

## What did I learn?

- Redis and Node is straight ðŸ”¥
- Discovered a new VS Code plugin (REST Client) for making HTTP requests inside code editor 
- Discovered a new middleware `response-time` which helps to see how long a request takes.
