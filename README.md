# Learn Node + Redis cache

This is my other attempt at building an application that caches requests using Node + Redis. The code might keep on evolving and changing overtime. I am trying to get my feet wet so that I can get comfortable with the techStack.

## Running the project

- Install all dependencies by running `yarn`
- Run the command `yarn start` to start up local server on port 4000
- Use postman or browser and use `http://localhost:4000/rockets`

## What did I learn and discover?

- Redis and Node is straight ðŸ”¥ and makes caching easier if the application is not complex 
- VS Code plugin - [REST Client] for making HTTP requests inside code editor ðŸš€ 
- Middleware `response-time` which helps when logging request times.
